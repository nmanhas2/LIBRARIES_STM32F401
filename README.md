Bare-metal STM32 Driver Libraries With Tests

Using this NUCLEO Dev-board: https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f401re.html

Used this package to obtain the header file used for some of the projects: https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cubef4.html. You only need Drivers -> CMSIS -> Device and Include folders

I've also included resources like the datasheet, reference manual, etc., that I used.
